# Neovim configuration

<img src="/other/images/screenshot.png" alt="Dotfiles screenshot" />

This is my Neovim configuration. As you might've guessed by the screenshots, this configuration is heavily inclined for
Frontend development, with support for Typescript, tsx, tailwind, and more. That being said, it's completely extendable
to suit any of your needs :)

Take from it what you need!

Always a WIP ðŸ˜…
